    *   Contains the website title/logo.
    *   Navigation bar with links to "Home", "News", "Forum", and "Login".
*   **Main Content Area:**
    *   **Hero Section:** A large, welcoming section with a background image and a call-to-action button.
    *   **Featured News:** A section to display the latest boxing news articles.
    *   **Community Forum Preview:** A section that gives a glimpse into the community forum discussions.
    *   **Upcoming Fights:** A section to display a schedule of upcoming boxing matches.
*   **Footer:**
    *   Includes social media links and copyright information.

### 2. Styling (`style.css`)

*   **Overall Design:** Modern, clean, and bold aesthetic.
*   **Color Palette:** A striking combination of black, white, red, and gold to evoke the spirit of boxing.
*   **Typography:** Use of strong, legible fonts.
*   **Layout:**
    *   Flexbox and Grid will be used for layout management.
    *   The website will be fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.
*   **Components:**
    *   Styled navigation bar.
    *   Cards for news articles and forum posts.
    *   Visually appealing buttons and links.
    *   Subtle animations and hover effects for interactivity.

### 3. JavaScript (`main.js`)

*   **Interactivity:**
    *   Smooth scrolling for navigation links.
    *   A simple carousel or slider for the hero section or featured content.
*   **Web Components:**
    *   Create custom elements for reusable components like article cards or forum posts.
    *   Example: `<boxing-article-card>` to display a news article.
